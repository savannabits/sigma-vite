# PrimeVue + Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite

This is a vitejs compatible version of PrimveFace's Free Admin Template, [SigmaVue](https://www.primefaces.org/sigma-vue), only with an improved modern look and other improvements:
* The template now supports material design themes in addition to saga, vela and arya.
* MD-Light is now the default starting theme.
* Theme configuration is persisted across reloads using localStorage
* Typescript is supported out of the box (Thanks to vitejs!)
* No more Looong build times during development, thanks to vitejs' lightning speed hmr!
